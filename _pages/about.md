ðŸ‘‹ Thats me, Tobi.

I am currently working at the hessian center for artificial intelligence ([hessian.ai](https://hessian.ai/)).

In addition to this I am currently looking for a concrete research topic for my Ph.D. There, I would like to research in the field of deep reinforcement learning and apply it to control complex energy or heating systems.
