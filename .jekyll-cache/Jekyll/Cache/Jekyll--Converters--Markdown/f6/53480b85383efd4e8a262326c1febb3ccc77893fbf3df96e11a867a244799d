I"=<p>Markov decision processes (MDPs) serve as a mathematical formalism to describe sequential decision making problems. It is used to formally define environments in reinforcement learning. The agent, which is the component that takes the decisions, interacts with this environment to learn a desired behavior in a trial and error manner. Note that the terms MDP and environment are often used interchangeably. Here, the term MDP is used when describing the formal properties, and the term environment when referring to implementation aspects of reinforcement learning.</p>
