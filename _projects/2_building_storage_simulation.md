The Building Energy Storage Simulation serves as open Source OpenAI gym (now gymnasium) environment for Reinforcement Learning. The environment represents a building with an energy storage (in form of a battery) and a solar energy system. The aim is to control the energy storage in such a way that the energy of the solar system can be used optimally.
